# imageResizer
a simple python code with GUI to resize images

here in this project i created a gui with tkinter and app just takes a picture and resize it, i was coded this because i needed to resize
my photos and online tools does not work how i wanted, so i created my own image resizer.
to run in just open terminal and run script as usual 
```console
$ python resizer.py
```
peace!
